What is important is to understand the Threat to better Hunt It Down before new victims come up. Over the years of working as a Cybersecurity Engineer, I’ve seen some compaigns, alerts, malwares, research papers, adversary patterns, ... All this gave me the idea of summarizing my knowledge and experience into a Notebook. And here it is, my very own Threat Hunting Book!\n\nPersonal Note: Threat Hunting (or Thrunting) is one of those activities in the technical field of Cybersecurity expertise that requires more consideration in my opinion. It’s often viewed as “part of” some other stuff, or considered as “best effort” only. My goal is not to “create” something dead impressive, but rather bring to the community what I’ve learned during my Thrunting trip, and just hope I can make it useful.","type":"content","url":"/#my-work","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Theat Hunting Book","lvl2":"What is this Notebook for?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#what-is-this-notebook-for","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Theat Hunting Book","lvl2":"What is this Notebook for?"},"content":"Present my previous, current and future work in the field of Threat Hunting & Analysis.\n\nContribute as much as possible to the community.\n\nProvide lessons learned and small courses that can help the learning.\n\nShare presentations material I’ve made during my conferences or guest talks.\n\nStore Proof of Concepts scripts or adversary simulation attack patterns and detection / signature rules (YARA, Sigma, EDR/SIEM Queries)\n\nFeel free to suggest anything using Pull Requests or Issues on my personal \n\nGithub Repo for these Pages.\n\nWarning\n\nThis Page is still under construction...
