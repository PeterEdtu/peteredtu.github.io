# Threat Hunting Book

## My work
Not hunting bad guys here, but their **tools and strategies**. What is important is to understand the **Threat** to better **Hunt It Down** before new victims come up. Over the years of working as a **Cybersecurity Engineer**, I've seen some campaigns, alerts, malwares, research papers, adversary patterns, ... All this gave me the idea of summarizing my knowledge and experience into a Notebook. And here it is, my very own **Threat Hunting Book**!

> **Personal Note:** Threat Hunting (or Thrunting) is one of those activities in the technical field of Cybersecurity expertise that requires more consideration in my opinion. It's often viewed as "part of" some other stuff, or considered as "best effort" only. My goal is not to "create" something dead impressive, but rather bring to the community what I've learned during my **Thrunting trip**, and just hope I can make it useful.

## What is this Notebook for?
- Present my previous, current and future work in the field of **Threat Hunting & Analysis**.
- Contribute as much as possible to the **community**.
- Provide **lessons learned and small courses** that can help the learning.
- Share **presentations material** I've made during my conferences or guest talks.
- Store **Proof of Concepts scripts** or adversary simulation attack patterns and **detection / signature rules** (YARA, Sigma, EDR/SIEM Queries)

Feel free to suggest anything using **Pull Requests** or **Issues** on my personal [Github Repo for these Pages](https://github.com/PeterEdtu/peteredtu.github.io).
